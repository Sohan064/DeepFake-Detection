# DeepFake-Detection
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deepfake detection model to differentiate between authentic and manipulated images. The project involved data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation. Additionally, integrated functionality to classify images as real or fake for real-time detection.
